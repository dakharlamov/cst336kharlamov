                Many computer simulations take advantage of the GPU to do many small tasks very quickly to generate a simulation of some physical phenomenon. Most of the time, GPUs are used for generating graphics, but GPUs can also be used to generate simulations by
                taking advantage of the compute shader -- a programming tool to do massive amounts of parrallel executions in a very short period of time. For one to be good at programming a compute shader, they must be good at parallelism. Many scientists
                today use the power of GPUs to drive their simulations and deep learning algorithms. Despite all the focus on data, GPUs in simulations are also used to create amazing visualizations of these simulations. These visualizations are
                generated by first simulating the phenomenon and then taking the data from the simulation to then display it on the screen by rendering geometry.

                Some examples of computer simulations include water simulation for films and games, hair simulation for films and games, stress simulations for engineering, kinematic simulations for physics, areodynamic simulations for aerospace, 
                cell growth simulations for biology, life simulations for ecology, space simulations for theoretical physics, and even weather simulations for meterology. Simulations are very well ingrained in the scientific community and it 
                is very clear to see the impact that computer graphics has in science and technology.
