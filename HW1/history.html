            <h1>Abridged History of Graphics</h1>
            <p>
                The first graphic to every be displayed on a screen was generated by an oscilloscope, which isn't a computer but an analog piece of machinary that measures voltage amplitudes versus time and graphs the results on a cathode ray tube (CRT)
                display. One year later in 1951, they were able to produce a real time display of video data using a computer that took up an entire room. In 1961, the first video game was displayed using an oscilloscope and the first computer drawing
                program was developed by Ivan Sutherland. This was also the year that a gigaFLOP of processing power became available to computing. A gigaFLOP meant 1 billon floating-point operations per second which was an incredible amount of processing
                power back back then, so much so that it would cost about $8 trillion in today's money (after inflation) to get your hands on such processing power in 1961. In 1965, Jack Bresenham developed the "ideal" line-drawing algorithm which made line
                graphics possible on computers. Before, graphics were drawn either by vector screens or by text arranged in a pattern to resemble the desired graphic. In 1972, <i>Pong</i> was created and the emergance of raster displays made raster graphics a
                possibility.

                The difference between <b>raster graphics</b> and <b>vector graphics</b> is an often asked question. This is probably due to the fact that we don't usually use vector displays anymore but we use vector graphics. Raster graphics means that the graphic in question
                is generated by filling a 2D grid with varying color values. Each cell in this grid is called a pixel. Most displays today display on a pixel per pixel basis making them raster displays. As a matter of fact, raster displays are so popular that most graphics cards only
                support raster displays. So why even mention vector graphics? Vector graphics still exist today and are quite popular. Vector graphics are produced by generating points and connecting them or filling them depending on how you want the drawing to be styled.
                The most common use for vector graphics is for creating scalable vector graphics (SVG) for things like logos that will most likely be required to be printed and displayed in many different sizes. Since the information is retained as a set of vectors, the image is easily scaled to
                any size making vector graphics very useful for scaling solutions. However, if there are no vector graphics displays, how can we work and view vector graphics? Once the graphic is made, one of two things happen. Either the graphic is scaled and then rasterized to turn it into
                a raster graphic, or the graphic is held in a file type like SVG to then be interpreted by our graphics cards to then be rasterized by our GPU. When displayed, vector graphics are usually not vector graphics by rasterizations of vector graphics. They still retain the quality in scaling
                but are no longer a set of points drawn on your screen. You might be asking yourself if there ever was a vector graphic display, and there were a few. Most notably were oscilloscopes and the Vectrex. Oscilloscopes work by tracing a dot on the screen that stops at certain points based on the input.
                The Vectrex was a video game console that had a vector graphic screen that made its graphics look far better than any other screen at the time. The only issue with vector graphic screens is that in order to produce the image desired, the image must be more or less a continuous stroke or the image
                might be truncated.

                In 1977, Apple released the Apple II which was the first personal computer to display graphics other than just text. Then in 1982, the incredibly popular Commodore 64 was released and was able to display raster graphics that could be displayed
                on regular TVs. Two years later, computer graphics had come so far in technological advancement that a gigaFLOP of processing power could be purchased for equivalent to today's $30 million; a huge difference from the $8 trillion it would cost in 1961.
                1984 was also the year that Apple started an ad campaign to show people how the computer should be designed for ease of use to support their release of the Macintosh which supported a mouse and a graphical user interface.
                In the years to come, many graphical advancements completely changed the world of computing from being able to render life-like people, to being able to simulate fluid dynamics, and to support more and more demanding video games on consoles.
                By 2013, it only cost 16 cents ($0.16) to produce a gigaFLOP of processing power. It is clear to see how graphics advanced in the history of computing and how those advancement drove much of how computing is defined and used by the general consumer.
