            <h1>Abridged History of Graphics</h1>
            <p>
                The first graphic to every be displayed on a screen where generated by an oscilloscope which technically
                isn't a computer but an analog piece of machinary that would measure voltage amplitudes versus time and graph the results on a cathode
                ray tube (CRT) display. One year later in 1951, they were able to produce a real time display of video data using a computer that took up an
                entire room. In 1961, the first video game was displayed using an oscilloscope and the first computer drawing program was developed by Ivan Sutherland. This was also the
                year that a gigaFLOP of processing power became available to computing. A gigaFLOP meant 1 billon floating-point operations per second which was an increadable amount of processing power
                back in 1961, so much so that it would cost about 8 trillion dollars in todays money after inflation to get your hands on such processing power.
                In 1965, Jack Bresenham developed the "ideal" line-drawing algorithm which made line graphics possible on computers. Before, graphics were draw either by vector screens or by text arranged in a pattern
                to resemble the desired graphic. In 1972, Pong was created and the emergance of raster displays made raster graphics a possibility.

            <h2>Raster vs Vector Graphics and Displays</h2>
            <p>
                In 1977 Apple released the Apple II, which was the first personal computer to support to display graphics other than just text. Then in 1982, the incredibly popular Commodore 64 was released and was able to display raster graphics that could be
                displayed on regular TVs. Two years later, computer graphics have gone so far in technological advancement that is now cost around $30 million dollars in todays money generate a GigaFLOP of processing power which was much better than the 1961 figure metioned earlier.
                1984 was also the year that Apple started an ad campaign to show people how the computer should be designed for ease of use to support their release of the Macintosh which supported a mouse and a graphical user interface.
