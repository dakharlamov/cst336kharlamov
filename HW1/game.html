                Video games direct the most attention to computer graphics because it's a platform where some of the most stunning computer graphics have been produced. Each year, game development studios work hard to try and improve the graphics and gameplay of their game to have
                a chance to sell their product on the game market. Every year, computers are pushed to their limits and beyond to generate stunning graphics for gamers. Many games can be measured by the amount of video ram they use or by the amount of
                vertices models in a scene can take up. While graphics is just one aspect of a game's quality, it is the most immediate thing consumers notice when shopping for a game or watching a gameplay trailer. This makes a game's graphics a major
                initial selling point.
