                Computer graphics is a large field of computer science that has to do with making graphics and showing projections and images to users. Computer graphics to the casual computer user may sound like video games or computer-generated imagery (CGI), but in
                fact, computer graphics appear in many other things like simulation, word processing, web design, and even mathematics. Computer graphics came from the need to create images and graphs on the screen for mathematician using computers. Recently,
                advances in computer graphics give us vivid and life-like imagery as wells as efficient and fast light alogrithm solving and other parallel tasks. Computers produce graphics by using a graphics procesing unit (GPU) that runs specially
                assemblies of graphics code writting by graphics programmers. Popular languages to produce computer graphics code are HLSL (high level shader language), CG (C for graphics), C++ with Directx, and OpenGL (open graphics language) to name
                a few. This site will talk about the general history of computer graphics and graphics cards, simulations, and graphics in the application of video games. The history of computer graphics and graphics cards section of the site
                can be reached <a href="history.html">here</a>. The computer graphics application of simulations portion of the site can be found <a href="sim.html">here</a>. Finally, the computer graphics application of 
                games on this site can be found <a href="game.html">here</a>.
